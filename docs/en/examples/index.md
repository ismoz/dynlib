# Examples Overview

Use these curated pages to find the most relevant runnable scripts. Each page describes what the example does, highlights the dynlib features it exercises, and links to the actual script in `examples/`.

## Catalog

- [`plotting.md`](plotting.md) – time-series/phase demos, plotting primitives, vector-field helpers, sweep/animation helpers, and theme previews.
- [`runtime.md`](runtime.md) – runtime diagnostics for accuracy, early exits, transition detection, and printing compiled equations.
- [`state-management.md`](state-management.md) – snapshots, source export, preset workflows, and URI resolution scripts that show how dynlib manages state/paths.
- [`bifurcation.md`](bifurcation.md) – logistic-map bifurcation diagrams plus comparison scripts.
- [`integer-map.md`](integer-map.md) – Collatz iteration example with map steppers and integer arithmetic assertions.
