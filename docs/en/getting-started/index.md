# Getting started with dynlib

These pages walk you through the first steps of using dynlib: from the high-level goals to a working model in just a few commands.

## Getting oriented

- [Overview](overview.md) — explains the philosophy behind dynlib, the core components (DSL, runtime, analysis helpers), and what the project bundles for dynamical-systems exploration.
- [Quickstart](quickstart.md) — installs dynlib, validates a builtin model, and runs the first simulation so you can confirm the toolchain works before writing your own models.
- [Your First Model](first-model.md) — builds a self-contained TOML model, wires it into `setup(...)`, steps it with a named stepper, and inspects the results with the simulation helpers.
